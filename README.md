# StGeorge
In this repository we will try to identify if Saint-George is on the image. Before entering into the classification, we will apply a few preprcessing steps. Afterwards, we will apply an achitecture trying to reach the highest accuracy. On the next section, we will specify the uses of each file. 

## Files 
1. Managing_dataset : This files intends to gather all images into one dataset. This dataset is filled with the images from the .csv files and the kaggle online dataset. 
2. Classifier : For this classification, we have fine tunned an xception model. The notebook can be modified to use other architecture and define other parameters.
